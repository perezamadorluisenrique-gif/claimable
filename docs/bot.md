# Claimable claim bot

A GitHub Action that lets contributors reserve an issue by commenting on it. It runs in your repository, with your repository's token: no server, no GitHub App, no secrets of ours.

It leaves one short comment per issue and edits it as things change. It never acts on a sentence like "can I take this?": only on an explicit command.

## Install

Start with `dry-run: true`. The bot then writes what it *would* do into the job summary and nothing else. When the summaries look right, remove the line.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/claim-bot.yml
name: Claim bot
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
permissions:
  issues: write
concurrency:
  group: claim-bot-${{ github.event.issue.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: false
jobs:
  claim:
    if: github.event.issue.pull_request == null && github.event.comment.user.type != 'Bot'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: perezamadorluisenrique-gif/claimable/bot@v1
        with:
          dry-run: true
```

No `actions/checkout` step is needed, and none should be added to run a commenter's code. `permissions: issues: write` is the only permission the bot uses.

## Commands

| Comment | Does |
|---|---|
| `/claim` (also `.take`, `/assign me`) | Assigns the issue to you, adds the `claimed` label, and says until when |
| `/unclaim` (also `/release`, `/unassign me`) | Releases it. Only the person who holds it or a maintainer can |
| `/claim status` | Says who holds it and the dates |

A command counts only as the first word of a line of your own text. A quote, a code block, inline code or a bot never gives one.

## When it says no

It names the reason and does not assign: the issue is closed, someone else holds it (or a maintainer assigned it by hand), a pull request by someone else is open against it, it carries a label like `on hold` or `blocked`, or you already hold two claims here.

## Inputs

| Input | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `token` | `github.token` | Token that assigns, labels and comments; needs `issues: write` |
| `dry-run` | `false` | Anything but `false` only describes the actions in the job summary |

Private repositories run in report-only mode for now: the bot says what it would do and does nothing.

## Notes

- Comments are read from the event file and the API; the text of a comment never reaches a shell, a path or a command.
- The `concurrency` block makes two simultaneous `/claim` comments on one issue run one after the other.
- If GitHub refuses a write (no permission, the person cannot be assigned here) the run ends green with a line in the job summary. The bot never fails your workflow.
- Threads of more than 1,000 comments or events are not read in full, so the bot does nothing on them.
- It remembers nothing outside the issue: the assignee, the timeline and a hidden marker in its own comment (honoured only when a bot wrote it).
