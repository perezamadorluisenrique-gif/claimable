/**
 * Filter 3 — is the issue blocked, or is it an umbrella?
 *
 * Two distinct situations that both look like "open and unassigned":
 *
 *   1. A label that means *do not start*. Some projects enforce this in
 *      writing — Sugar Labs' `on hold` reads "Do not work on this until marked
 *      ready". Zero comments on such an issue means "not specified yet", not
 *      "nobody has claimed it". That inversion is the single easiest way to
 *      waste a week.
 *
 *   2. An umbrella issue, which is not a blocker at all. On umbrella issues you
 *      claim a *unit of work* — one spec file, one module — not the issue, and
 *      several people work under the same number at once. So a high comment
 *      count there means active, not contested. Only an explicit "don't send
 *      PRs against this" turns an umbrella into a wall.
